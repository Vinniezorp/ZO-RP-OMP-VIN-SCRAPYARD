## Why?
ZO-RP has for its whole lifetime been closed source. Only a select few people have ever had access to versions of the game mode. I have decided that in the best interest of preserving this game mode and hopefully building it up into something truly amazing that I will open source the latest version I have been working on. The hope is that in time, more people can contribute to the source and we can create the best Zombie Roleplay server on the Open Multiplayer platform. This also takes the pressure off me being the only developer and allows the server to have better and potentially more frequent updates.

## Contributing
You can contribute code by submitting a pull request. All pull requests need to be signed off by myself (or eventually other trusted developers) before it is merged into the main branch's source code. The source code is released under the ![GPL-3.0 license](https://github.com/zombie-outbreak/ZO-RP-OMP/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Libraries Required
You will require the following libraries to run and compile the game mode. They have not been included with this source code as they are separate open source projects. Logan's map file is also not included with this source as it is his project, and he updates and allows me usage of it for the ZO-RP server only, not for other servers.
